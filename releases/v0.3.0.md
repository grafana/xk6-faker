xk6-faker `v0.3.0` is here with a new JavaScript-like [API](https://ivan.szkiba.hu/xk6-faker/) ðŸŽ‰!

This release includes:

- New JavaScript-like API
- API doc generated by TypeDoc

## Breaking changes

### New JavaScript-like API

One of the goals of the refactor is to replace the previous xk6-faker API, which mirrors the underlying go library API, with an API similar to the popular JavaScript faker libraries.

Another important goal was to increase maintainability. The previous implementation contained a lot of manually created, difficult-to-maintain code and test code. After the refactor, the codes and test codes that required a lot of manual work disappeared, code generation replaces them in many places.

## New features

### API doc generated by TypeDoc

The new [API documentation website](https://ivan.szkiba.hu/xk6-faker/) is much clearer and easier to use than the previous documentation. The generation is done using TypeDoc, which can be considered standard, so the appearance is similar to that of the usual TypeScript API documentation sites.
